I want to add some recipes. After clicking the add recipe button I want
some items that can be selected for example- rice, beef, chicken, egg,oats,
banana, apple, peanuts, soup, noodles. water , soft drinks. Each of the element
will have an add option and in the mean time the complete meal will be shown with
the selected items after the selection the complete
meal will show the total amount of calories consumed and total 
water intake this water intake amount will be used afterward
for water goal feature and the calories will be used to calculate 
the nutrition . I will upload some images of the items and I will add
some more items afterwards so keep that option for me.
